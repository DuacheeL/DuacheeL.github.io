          <h1>Hey, I’m Duachee!</h1>
      
          <p>  I am a first generation Hmong American who is currently pursuing a degree in Visual Communications of Design at Eastern Washington University. My passion for design started when I was in high school. I randomly took a graphic design class for my art credit and it led me to where I am now! I am a loud introvert...at least that’s what people tell me. Once you get to know me, I could be loud, obnoxious, and cheerful. Outside of school, I play volleyball for fun and lead a traditional Hmong dance team! </p>
